# Full-Screen Ultra-Minimal Gaming Dashboard Interface

## Design Overview
Design a full-screen, ultra-minimal, premium gaming dashboard for tracking games and progress. Focus on layout, spacing, typography, and aesthetic — not placeholder content. Use a 2-column structure where needed, consistent visual rhythm, soft shadows, and large touch targets. Every screen should feel polished and deliberate, with a native app-like feel.

## UI Style Guidelines

### Aesthetic
- Apple-like calm aesthetic with subtle gradients or shadows
- Color palette: neutral background (#F9FAFB or similar), dark text (#1A1A1A), elegant accent color (vibrant orange or electric blue)

### Typography
- Use Inter or SF Pro
- Bold headlines (24–32px)
- Medium labels
- Fine secondary text

### Spacing & Layout
- Generous padding (24–40px)
- Consistent vertical rhythm
- Cards: Rounded corners (2xl), hover shadows, light dividers inside
- Icons: Lucide or Feather-style line icons, clean and consistent
