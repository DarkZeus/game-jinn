# Component Development Guidelines

## Component Structure
- Components should be placed in `src/components/`
- Each component should have its own directory with the following structure:
  ```
  component-name/
  ├── index.tsx        # Main component file
  ├── types.ts         # Component-specific types
  └── styles.css       # Component-specific styles (if needed)
  ```
- All files and directories should use kebab-case naming convention (e.g., `user-profile/`, `auth-form/`, `button-group/`)

## UI Components
This project uses Shadcn UI components. To add new components:

1. Install using the shadcn CLI:
   ```bash
   pnpx shadcn@latest add [component-name]
   ```

2. Available components include:
   - Button
   - Dialog
   - Dropdown Menu
   - Label
   - Progress
   - Select
   - Separator
   - Switch
   - Tabs
   - Tooltip

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow the project's color scheme and design system
- Use the `cn()` utility from `src/lib/utils.ts` for conditional class names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all components
- Implement proper prop types and interfaces
- Use React Query for data fetching
- Follow the project's error handling patterns
- Write tests for complex components
- Document complex logic with comments
