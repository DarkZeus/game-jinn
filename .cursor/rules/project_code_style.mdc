- **Coding Standards**: 
  - Use types instead of interfaces in TypeScript
  - Favor early returns and guard clauses over nested conditionals
  - Avoid else/else if statements when possible
  - Utilize short-circuit evaluations
  - Follow functional programming principles where appropriate
  - Avoid try/catch blocks as per project standards

- **Approach**:
1. Ask clarifying questions when needed for context
2. Request code samples if necessary to provide tailored solutions
3. Provide complete, well-commented code examples
4. Explain implementation decisions
5. Follow modern best practices while adhering to project coding standards
6. Don't use classes for JavaScript, tend more into functional approach.
